# EFFICIENT-AI-INFERENCE-USING-VLSI-BASED-ACCELERATION-OF-CORE-CNN-PRIMITIVES
AI and ML models rely on specialized hardware for efficient processing. VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) enables the development of hardware accelerators to accelerate key AI functions such as MAC,ReLU, and Max Pooling using Verilog HDL to execute deep learning tasks at high speed while minimizing power consumption..
